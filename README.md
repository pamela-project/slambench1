SLAMBench Release Candidate 1.2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pamela-project/slambench.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pamela-project/slambench)

  Copyright (c) 2014 University of Edinburgh, Imperial College, University of Manchester.

  Developed in the PAMELA project, EPSRC Programme Grant EP/K008730/1

## What is it for? ##

* A SLAM performance benchmark that combines a framework for quantifying quality-of-result with instrumentation of execution time and energy consumption. 
* It contains a KinectFusion (http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/155378/ismar2011.pdf) implementation in C++, OpenMP, OpenCL, SYCL and CUDA (inspired by https://github.com/GerhardR).
* It offers a platform for a broad spectrum of future research in jointly exploring the design space of algorithmic and implementation-level optimisations. 
* Target desktop, laptop, mobile and embedded platforms. Tested on Ubuntu, OS X and Android (on Android only the benchmark application has been ported, see later).

## How do I get set up on Ubuntu? ##
If you want to set up for OS X go to the relevant section. 

### Dependencies ###

#### Required ####

* TooN: maths library.
* CMake 2.8+ : building tool.

##### Install TooN and CMake#####

```
#!shell
git clone git://github.com/edrosten/TooN.git
cd TooN
./configure
sudo make install
sudo apt-get install cmake

```
+(with Ubuntu, you might need to install the  build-essential package using ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential```)
 

#### Optional ####

* OpenMP : for the OpenMP version
* CUDA : for the CUDA version
* OpenCL : for the OpenCL version (OpenCL 1.1 or greater)
* ComputeCpp & [syclcc](https://github.com/agozillon/syclcc) : for the SYCL version (ComputeCpp 0.3.0 or greater) 

* OpenGL / GLUT : used by the graphical interface
* OpenNI : for the live mode, and for `oni2raw` tool (which convert an OpenNI file to the SLAMBench internal format)
* Freenect Drivers : In order to use the live mode.
* PkgConfig / Qt5 (using OpenGL) : used by the Qt graphical interface (not fully required to get a graphical interface)
* Python (numpy) : use by benchmarking scripts (`mean`, `max`, `min` functions)

##### Installation of Qt5 with an ARM board (ie. Arndale, ODROID,...) #####

On ARM board, the default release of Qt5 was compile using OpenEGL, to use the Qt interface, you will have to compile Qt :

```
#!
cd ~
wget http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/5.2/5.2.1/single/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.2.1.tar.gz
tar xzf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.2.1.tar.gz
cd ~/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.2.1
./configure -prefix ~/.local/qt/ -no-compile-examples  -confirm-license  -release   -nomake tests   -nomake examples
make
make install
```

### Compilation of SLAMBench ###

Then simply build doing: 

```
#!
make
```

To use qt, if you compile the source as explained above, you should need to specify the Qt install dir :
```
#!
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/.local/qt/ make
```

#### Compilation of SYCL Module ####

To compile the SYCL benchmarks you require the syclcc scripts from: https://github.com/agozillon/syclcc

You will also require the ComputeCpp SYCL compiler. The benchmarks have been 
tested and compile with ComputeCpp Versions 0.2.1 to 2.0.0 on Ubuntu. The 
benchmarks work best with versions 0.3.2 and above. It's worth noting that you 
should set the SYCLCC_COMPUTECPP_BACKEND enviornment variable to spirv64 for 
ComputeCpp versions 1.2.0+ when used with Intel's OpenCL CPU driver. You may also
wish to modify the backend target via SYCLCC_COMPUTECPP_BACKEND depending on 
your chosen hardware.

Ubuntu Steps:
1) Create an environment variable COMPUTECPP_DIR that points to your ComputeCpp 
   root directory.
2) Add the root of the syclcc installation directory to your PATH.
   (Further information for steps 1 and 2 can be found in the syclcc readme).
3) Set the CXX environment variable to syclcc, ComputeCpp will be used as the 
   default SLAMBench compiler now, for everything except the OpenMP and CUDA 
   modules.
4) Now invoke CMake.
5) Compile the desired sycl modules using make; for example make kfusion-qt-sycl

Optional Steps:
1) Set the SYCLCC_COMPUTECPP_BACKEND environment variable before compilation to 
   modify the underlying hardware target for SYCL kernels. e.g: 
    `export SYCLCC_COMPUTECPP_BACKEND=spirv64`
2) Set the COMPUTECPP_TARGET enviornment variable, this tells the SYCL runtime 
   which backend it must select if your system has multiple available backends.
   This can be a cause of runtime errors, as the SYCL runtime may select the 
   incorrect backend for your compiled binaries. This can also be handled by a 
   SYCL selector class, if a user wishes to alter the SLAMBench SYCL module to 
   add one. An example usage: `export COMPUTECPP_TARGET=intel:cpu`, this 
   restricts SYCL to Intel CPU backends. Further documentation for this variable
   can be found in ComputeCpp documentation, as it's a ComputeCpp environment 
   variable.

The CMake commands for building the module inside a subdirectory of the SLAMBench root directory:

```
#!
export CXX=syclcc && cmake ..
make kfusion-benchmark-sycl
make kfusion-qt-sycl
```

### Running SLAMBench ###

The compilation builds 3 application modes which act like wrappers (the kernels are the same for all applications): 

1. benchmark: terminal user interface mode for benchmarking purposes
2. main: GLUT GUI visualisation mode
3. qmain: Qt GUI visualisation mode

Each application mode is also declined in 4 different builds/implementations:

* C++ (*./build/kfusion/kfusion-main-cpp*) 
* OpenMP (*./build/kfusion/kfusion-main-openmp*)
* OpenCL (*./build/kfusion/kfusion-main-cpp*) 
* CUDA (*./build/kfusion/kfusion-main-cuda*) 
* SYCL (*./build/kfusion/kfusion-main-sycl*) 

The Makefile will automatically build the executable with satisfied dependencies, e.g. the OpenCL application version will be built only if the OpenCL tool kit is available on the system and so on for CUDA, OpenMP and Qt.

All application modes and implementations share the same set of arguments:

```
#!plain
-c  (--compute-size-ratio)       : default is 1   (same size)      
-d  (--dump-volume) <filename>   : Output volume file   
-f  (--fps)                      : default is 0
-i  (--input-file) <filename>    : Input camera file               
-k  (--camera)                   : default is defined by input     
-l  (--icp-threshold)        : default is 1e-05
-o  (--log-file) <filename>      : default is stdout               
-m  (--mu)                       : default is 0.1               
-p  (--init-pose)                : default is 0.5,0.5,0     
-q (--no-gui)                    : disable any gui used by the executable
-r  (--integration-rate)         : default is 1     
-s  (--volume-size)              : default is 2,2,2      
-t  (--tracking-rate)            : default is 1     
-v  (--volume-resolution)        : default is 256,256,256    
-y  (--pyramid-levels)           : default is 10,5,4 
-z  (--rendering-rate)   : default is 4
```

SLAMBench supports several input streams (how to use these inputs is described later): 

* ICL-NUIM dataset (http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/VaFRIC/iclnuim.html)
* RGB-D camera like Microsoft Kinect or other PrimeSense cameras using the OpenNI interface
* OpenNI pre-recorded file
* Raw format


#### 1. benchmark mode ####

Use this mode for benchmarking proposes. The output is: 

* frame          : ID number of the current frame
* acquisition    : input data acquisition elapsed time (file reading)
* preprocessing  : pre-processing elapsed time (includes kernels mm2meters bilateralFilter)
* tracking       : tracking elapsed time (includes kernels halfSample, depth2vertex vertex2normal, track,  reduce and solve)
* integration    : integration elapsed time (includes kernel integrate)
* raycast          : raycast elapsed time (include kernel raycast)
* rendering      : rendering elapsed time (includes kernels renderDepth renderTrack and renderVolume)
* computation  : pre-processing + tracking + integration + raycast. This is the total elapsed time for processing a frame but not including the acquiring and the visualisation kernels
* total  : computation + acquisition + rendering. This is the total elapsed time for processing one frame (including the acquiring and the visualisation kernels)
* X,Y,Z  : estimation of the camera position (tracking result)
* tracked : this boolean indicates if for the current frame we have not lost the tracking of the camera (1 = tracking, 0 = tracking lost)
* integrated : this boolean indicates if the integration step occurs for the current frame (depending of the tracking result and of the integration rate)


##### How to use the benchmark mode with the ICL-NUIM dataset #####

SLAMBench provides an interface to the ICL-NUIM dataset. 
This enables the accuracy evaluation on a SLAM implementation via the ICL-NUIM ground truth. 
ICL-NUIM provides 4 trajectories, we pick trajectory 2 and show how to use the dataset (for the download of each trajectory we recommend 2 GB of space available on the system):

```
#!plain
mkdir living_room_traj2_loop
cd living_room_traj2_loop
wget http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/living_room_traj2_loop.tgz
tar xzf living_room_traj2_loop.tgz
cd ..
```

You can use the ICL-NUIM dataset in its native format or in a RAW format (with the latter acquiring speed increases). 
RAW is the format to be used for benchmarking purposes, to generate the RAW file: 

```
#!plain
./build/kfusion/thirdparty/scene2raw living_room_traj2_loop living_room_traj2_loop.raw
```

Run SLAMBench:

```
#!plain
./build/kfusion/kfusion-benchmark-cuda -i living_room_traj2_loop.raw  -s 4.8 -p 0.34,0.5,0.24 -z 4 -c 2 -r 1 -k 481.2,480,320,240  > benchmark.log
```
You can replace *cuda* by *openmp*, *opencl* or *cpp*.

In order to check the accuracy of your tracking compared to the ground truth trajectory, first download the ground truth trajectory file: 
```
#!plain
wget http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/VaFRIC/livingRoom2.gt.freiburg
```
And then use the following tool:
```
#!plain
./kfusion/thirdparty/checkPos.py benchmark.log livingRoom2.gt.freiburg 
Get slambench data. 
slambench result        : 882 positions.
NUIM  result        : 880 positions.
Working position is : 880
Runtimes are in seconds and the absolute trajectory error (ATE) is in meters.
The ATE measure accuracy, check this number to see how precise your computation is.
Acceptable values are in the range of few centimeters.

            tracking 	Min : 0.005833 	Max : 0.046185 	Mean : 0.020473 	Total : 18.05721755

                 ATE 	Min : 0.000000 	Max : 0.044235 	Mean : 0.018392 	Total : 16.18503741
         acquisition 	Min : 0.000069 	Max : 0.000404 	Mean : 0.000086 	Total : 0.07543481
```

#### 2. main mode ####

This is a GUI mode which internally uses GLUT for the visualisation step. 
We do not suggest to use this mode for benchmarking purposes because the visualisation step can interfere with the computation elapsed time (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2167 for more information).  

An example of use of the main application is: 

```
#!plain
./build/kfusion/kfusion-main-cpp -i ~/Downloads/living_room_traj2_loop/

```

## Live mode ##

To run the live mode (using a Depth Sensor), you need to connect the Sensor, and to install the proper drivers.
Here is the procedure with Fedora 24 :
```
# root user
yum install libudev-devel
```

Then as normal user, you will compile OpenNI2:
```
git clone https://github.com/occipital/OpenNI2.git OpenNI2dev
cd OpenNI2dev
sed -i.bak "s/.javaDocExe, .-d., .java../[javaDocExe, '-d', 'java', '-Xdoclint:none']/" Source/Documentation/Runme.py
cd Packaging
./ReleaseVersion.py x64
```

This command output finishes by ```Done```. Then you need to install OpenNI2 :
```
cd Final
mkdir -p  ~/.local/OpenNI2/
tar xf OpenNI-Linux-x64-2.2.tar.bz2 -C  ~/.local/OpenNI2
cd ~/.local/OpenNI2/OpenNI-Linux-x64-2.2/
export OPENNI2_INCLUDE=/home/toky/.local/OpenNI2/OpenNI-Linux-x64-2.2/Include
export OPENNI2_REDIST=/home/toky/.local/OpenNI2/OpenNI-Linux-x64-2.2/Redist
```

Possible error :
```
[toky@localhost Packaging]$ ./ReleaseVersion.py x64
Creating installer for OpenNI 2.2 x64
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./ReleaseVersion.py", line 170, in <module>
    subprocess.check_call(['make', '-C', '../', '-j' + calc_jobs_number(), 'PLATFORM=' + plat, 'release'], stdout=buildLog, stderr=buildLog)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/subprocess.py", line 541, in check_call
    raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd)
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['make', '-C', '../', '-j2', 'PLATFORM=x64', 'release']' returned non-zero exit status 2
```

Our advice to fix this error is to manually run the command, to see the real problem (in this case we have seen libudev.h was missing) :
```
toky@localhost Packaging]$ make -C .. PLATFORM=x64 release
make: Entering directory '/home/toky/work/pamela/slambench/OpenNI2'

make: *** [ThirdParty/PSCommon/XnLib/Source] Error 2
make: Leaving directory '/home/toky/work/pamela/slambench/OpenNI2'
```

To use a Kinect sensor, you will need libfreenect :

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect.git
cd libfreenect
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_OPENNI2_DRIVER=ON
make
cp -L lib/OpenNI2-FreenectDriver/libFreenectDriver.so ~/.local/OpenNI2/OpenNI-Linux-x64-2.2/Redist/OpenNI2/Drivers/
```

#### 3. mainQt mode ####

This is a GUI mode which internally uses Qt for the visualisation step. 
We do not suggest to use this mode for benchmarking purposes because the visualisation step can interfere with the computation elapsed time (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2167 for more information).  

An example of use of the mainQt application is: 
```
#!plain
./build/kfusion/kfusion-qt-cpp -i ~/Downloads/living_room_traj2_loop/

```
## Kernel timings ##

### CPP ###
```
#!plain
KERNEL_TIMINGS=1 ./build/kfusion/kfusion-benchmark-cpp -s 4.8 -p 0.34,0.5,0.24 -z 4 -c 2 -r 1 -k 481.2,480,320,240 -i  living_room_traj2_loop.raw -o  benchmark.2.cpp.log 2> kernels.2.cpp.log
```

### OpenMP ###
```
#!plain
KERNEL_TIMINGS=1 ./build/kfusion/kfusion-benchmark-openmp -s 4.8 -p 0.34,0.5,0.24 -z 4 -c 2 -r 1 -k 481.2,480,320,240 -i  living_room_traj2_loop.raw -o  benchmark.2.openmp.log 2> kernels.2.openmp.log
```

### OpenCL ###

It is possible to profile OpenCL kernels using an OpenCL wrapper from the thirdparty folder : 
```
#!plain
LD_PRELOAD=./build/kfusion/thirdparty/liboclwrapper.so ./build/kfusion/kfusion-benchmark-opencl -s 4.8 -p 0.34,0.5,0.24 -z 4 -c 2 -r 1 -k 481.2,480,320,240 -i  living_room_traj2_loop.raw -o benchmark.2.opencl.log 2>  kernels.2.opencl.log
```

### CUDA ###

The CUDA profiling takes advantage of the NVIDIA nvprof profiling tool. 
```
#!plain
nvprof --print-gpu-trace ./build/kfusion/kfusion-benchmark-cuda -s 4.8 -p 0.34,0.5,0.24 -z 4 -c 2 -r 1 -k 481.2,480,320,240 -i  living_room_traj2_loop.raw -o  benchmark.2.cuda.log 2> tmpkernels.2.cuda.log || true
cat  tmpkernels.2.cuda.log | kfusion/thirdparty/nvprof2log.py >   kernels.2.cuda.log
```

### SYCL ###
```
#!plain
KERNEL_TIMINGS=1 ./build/kfusion/kfusion-benchmark-sycl -s 4.8 -p 0.34,0.5,0.24 -z 4 -c 2 -r 1 -k 481.2,480,320,240 -i  living_room_traj2_loop.raw -o  benchmark.2.sycl.log 2> kernels.2.sycl.log
```

## Automatic timings ##

When using the ICL-NUIM dataset, it is possible to generate the timings using only one command. 
If the living room trajectory files (raw + trajectory ground truth) are not in the directory they will be automatically downloaded. 
 
In the following command, we use trajectory 2 and we generate the timings for the OpenCL version only: 
```
make 2.opencl.log
```

In order to use all the available languages and for all the available trajectories do the following: 
```
make 0.cpp.log 0.opencl.log 0.openmp.log 0.cuda.log
make 1.cpp.log 1.opencl.log 1.openmp.log 1.cuda.log
make 2.cpp.log 2.opencl.log 2.openmp.log 2.cuda.log
make 3.cpp.log 3.opencl.log 3.openmp.log 3.cuda.log
```


## Parameters for different dataset trajectories (Living Room) ##

These parameters are also present in the Makefile and can be used with the command above, see Automatic timings section. 

Trajectory 0 : offset = 0.34,0.5,0.24,  voxel grid size = 5.0m (max ATE = 0.1m,    mean ATE = 0.01m)

Trajectory 1 : offset = 0.485,0.5,0.55, voxel grid size = 5.0m (max ATE = 0.06m,   mean ATE = 0.028m)

Trajectory 2 : offset = 0.34,0.5,0.24,  voxel grid size = 4.8m (max ATE = 0.044m,  mean ATE = 0.02m)

Trajectory 3 : offset = 0.2685,0.5,0.4, voxel grid size = 5.0m (max ATE = 0.292m,  mean ATE = 0.117m)

###Power measurement ###
Currently  power measurement is only implemented on Hardkernel boards implementing power monitoring using on board sensors, ODROID-XUE and ODROID-XU3.  When executing on these platforms a file power.rpt is produced at the end of each run, this will contain a frame by frame analysis of mean power and time for each frame.  The power is separated between, the Cortex-A7, Cortex-A15, GPU and DRAM.

Running kfusion/thirdparty/processPowerRpt <power.rpt> will produce total energy used by each resource during  the processing of the sequence.  

In the Qt interface power is monitored and graphed on a frame by frame basis, the graphing will only be visible on a suitably equipped board.  The power monitor, and indeed all statistics logging, is on a per sequence basis i.e. if you open/restart a scene/file the  logging will restart.  The statistics for a run can be saved by selecting File->Save power from the main menu when the run has been completed, statistics are only recorded when frames are processing, pausing the sequence should not impact on the final statistics.

In the future we propose to add support for power estimation using on chip counters where available, this should be included in a future release.

## Set up on OS X ##

**Warning**: SLAMBench is widely tested and fully supported on Ubuntu. The OS X version may result instable. We reckon to use the Ubuntu version.

* ** Failure to track using OpenCL on AMD **  -Some issues have been reported on AMD platforms, we will look into this
* **Visualisation using QT**  - may be offset on some platforms - notably ARM
* **Build issues using QT on ARM ** - Visualisation requires opengl but Qt on ARM is often built using GLES, including packages obtained from distribution repo.  Building from source with opengl set to desktop resolves this. 
* ** Frame rates on QT GUI appear optimistic** -  The rate shown in the status bar is by default the computation time to process the frame and render any output, it excludes the time take by the QT interface to display the rendered images and acquire frame
* ** performance difference between CUDA/OpenCL** - This is a known issue that we are investigating. It's mainly cause by a difference of global work-group size between the both version and a major slowdown of CUDA in the rendering kernels is cause by the use of float3 instead of float4 which result by an alignment issue. this alignment issue doesn't appear in OpenCL as cl_float3 are the same as cl_float4.
* ** CUDA nvprof slows down the performance on some platforms** - the nvprof instrumentation has a 2x slowdown on MAC OS for the high-level KFusion building blocks. So if we run using make 2.cuda.log we will not measure the maximum speed of the machine for the high-level building blocks. It is questionable then if we should keep measuring the CUDA high-level and low-level performance at the same time or in order to be more accurate it is better to run the two measurements in two separate runs. 
* ** OS X version has not been widely tested **
